\title{Calculate harvest rule (Minoli et al., 2019)}
\usage{
calcHarvestRule(croppar, monthly_temp, monthly_ppet, seasonality)
}
\description{
This function performs an agro-climatic classification of
climate, based on monthly temperature and precipitation profiles.
The classification is derived by intersecting the seasonality classes (see
calcSeasonality) with the temperature of the warmest month, compared to
crop-specific thresholds (base and optimal temperatures for reproductive
growth):
t-low, temperatures always lower than the base temperature;
t-mid, temperatures exceed the base temperature, but are always lower than
the optimum temperature;
t-high, temperatures exceed the optimum temperature.
