\usage{
calcMonthlyClimate(
  lat = NULL,
  temp = NULL,
  prec = NULL,
  syear = NULL,
  eyear = NULL,
  incl_feb29 = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat}{latitude (decimal value)}

\item{temp}{daily temperature (degree Celsius) for a number of years
(syear:eyear). It should be passed in form of a vector.}

\item{prec}{daily precipitation (mm) for a number of years (syear:eyear).
It should be passed in form of a vector.}

\item{syear}{start year in the climate time series.}

\item{eyear}{end year in the climate time series.}

\item{incl_feb29}{Does the time series include February 29th in leap years?}
}
\value{
list of five vectors of length 12:
mtemp, mprec, mpet, mppet, mppet_diff.
}
\description{
Calculate monthly climate variables needed for the computation
of the rule-based crop calendars (Waha et al., 2012; Minoli et al., 2019):
average monthly mean temperature (mtemp);
average monthly cumulative precipitation (mprec);
average monthy cumulative potential evapotranspiration (mpet);
dryness index 1, mprec-to-mpet ratio (mppet);
dryness index 2, difference of mppet of two consecutive months (mppet_diff).
P-to-PET (mppet) ratio indicates the water surplus or deficit with respect to
the plant water demand; P-to-PET ratio difference (ppet_diff) indicates the
monthly trend in moisture conditions, if mppet_diff[m] > 0,
the trend is declining, indicating that the following month (m + 1) is
dryer than month m.
