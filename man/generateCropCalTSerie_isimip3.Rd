\description{
This function assembles
 crop calendars of individual time slices (stored in data.tables)
 into a continuous annual time series and saves it in ncdf file.
The function performs some filtering of crop calendar dates to avoid
 discontinuities and to replace default dates with observed dates.
The function has arguments, as all variables should be defined in the
 script that calls this function. This is non-optimal, but fine as
 the function is very specific for a single dataset (isimip3).
