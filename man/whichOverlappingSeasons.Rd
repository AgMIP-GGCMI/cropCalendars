\usage{
whichOverlappingSeasons(sdate = NULL, hdate = NULL, syear = NULL, eyear = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sdate}{vector of sowing dates (DOY)}

\item{hdate}{vector of harvest dates (DOY)}

\item{syear}{numeric value, first year in the dates time serie}

\item{eyear}{numeric value, last year in the dates time serie}
}
\description{

growing seasons. sdate and hdate are vectors of sowing and
harvest date (DOY) of length = length(syear:eyear).
}

                        hdate = c(120, 120, 210),
                        syear = 2000,
